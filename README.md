#Closet++

Created with: Ruby on Rails, Backbone.js, JavaScript, JQuery, HTML5, CSS3

Closet++ is a clothing subscription web app exclusively for guys. Merely submit your measurements and clothing styles/preferences, and a stylist will pick out clothing to mail to you. Keep it if you like it, return it if you don't. Subscriptions can be monthly, bimonthly, or trimonthly, and can also be paused at any time. Specify your budget as well as how many clothing items (and type of clothing, e.g. jeans, blazers, shorts) you'd like per shipment!

An extra feature: a clothing inventory that allows you to purchase items we currently have in our inventory, if you see something you'd like!

(Note: Closet++ is a mockup, not an actual subscription service)

Log in as a demo user to check it out! Admins can add and edit new items; consumers only have access to view and purchase items.
